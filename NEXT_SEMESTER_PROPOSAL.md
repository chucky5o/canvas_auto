# Course Improvement Proposal: INF-102 Introduction to Computing
**Context:** 1-Credit Course | 14 Weeks | Entry-Level

## Executive Summary
This course currently covers a broad spectrum: Basic Hardware/Software, Office Productivity (Word/Excel), Networking, Cloud, and Python Programming. For a **1-credit course**, this is an ambitious curriculum. The transition from "Using Word" to "Writing Python Code" is a significant difficulty spike for entry-level students.

## 1. Structural Analysis & Pacing
**Current Issue:** The difficulty curve is non-linear.
- **Weeks 1-6:** Concepts & Office Tools (Low difficulty, high familiarity).
- **Weeks 7-10:** Networking & Cloud (Medium difficulty, conceptual).
- **Weeks 11-14:** Python Programming (High difficulty, abstract logic).

**Proposal:** Smooth the curve by introducing "Computational Thinking" earlier, without code.

### Proposed 14-Week Flow
| Phase | Focus | Key Topics | Assignment Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Foundations (Wk 1-4)** | How Computers Work | Hardware, OS, Cloud, Digital Literacy | Physical/Digital "Build a PC" Sim, file management. |
| **Phase 2: Productivity (Wk 5-8)** | Using Computers Effectively | Excel (Data), Word (Communication), PPT (Presentation) | Real-world scenario (e.g., "Budgeting for a Trip"). |
| **Phase 3: The Internet (Wk 9-10)** | How We Connect | Networking, Security, AI Ethics | Trace-route lab, Security Audit checklist. |
| **Phase 4: Logic (Wk 11-14)** | Telling Computers What to Do | Algorithms, Logic (Scratch or Python) | "Recipe" algorithms, Simple Code. |

## 2. Resource & Topic Improvements

### A. "Programming" vs. "Computational Thinking"
**Current State:** Students jump into Python syntax (`input()`, `float()`, taxes). This often causes anxiety in 1-credit courses.
**Recommendation:**
*   **Option A (Gentler):** Use **Block-Based Coding** (Scratch or Code.org) for Week 11-12 to teach loops/variables *visually* before showing Python text in Week 13.
*   **Option B (Practical):** Focus on **Data Logic** in Excel. "Programming" can be complex Excel formulas (`=IF()`), which bridges the gap between Office skills and logic.
*   **Resource:** [Code.org CS Principles](https://code.org/educate/csp) (Intro units).

### B. Modernizing "Networking"
**Current State:** Definitions (LAN/WAN) and History.
**Recommendation:** Pivot to **"How the Internet Works for YOU"**.
*   **Topics:** WiFi speeds, 5G vs 4G, VPNs, and *Cybersecurity*.
*   **Resource:** [Google's Interland](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland) (Gamified security concepts).

### C. Leveraging AI
**Current State:** Policy warns *against* AI.
**Recommendation:** Teach *ethical usage*.
*   **New Assignment:** "AI Fact Checker". Generate a text using ChatGPT, then have students verify it and highlight errors using Word "Track Changes". This combines Word skills with critical thinking.

## 3. Assignment Variety (Low-Load, High-Impact)
To respect the 1-credit limit, reduce "busy work" (long essays) and increase "active work".

1.  **Micro-Labs (15 mins):**
    *   *Example:* "Run a speed test (fast.com), screenshot it, and explain why your upload is slower than download." (Networking).
2.  **Peer Reviews:**
    *   Use Canvas Discussions. Students post their "Build a PC" parts list; others comment on compatibility.
3.  **Video Reflections:**
    *   Instead of a 2-page PDF, allow a 2-minute video recording for the Final Reflection. (Easier to grade, more authentic connection).

## 4. Specific Action Items for Next Semester
1.  **Refine Module 5 (Programming):** Add a "Pre-Coding" assignment. Ask students to write a "Algorithm for making a Sandwich" to teach step-by-step logic before syntax.
2.  **Update Module 4 (Word):** Change the prompt from "Write sentences about yourself" to "Create a Professional Resume". It's the same Word skills (formatting, bolding) but adds tangible career value.
3.  **Update Module 2 (Hardware):** Use [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) for the "Build a Computer" assignment. It automatically checks compatibility and pricing, making the assignment fun and realistic.

## 5. Workload Check
*   **Current:** ~6 heavy assignments in last 6 weeks.
*   **Ideal:** 1 small task *every* week. Regular, small touches are better for retention in 1-credit courses than monthly big projects.
